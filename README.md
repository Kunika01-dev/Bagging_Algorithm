# Bagging_Algorithm

<h2> Credit Default Prediction </h2>
<p>Decision trees are a simple and powerful predictive modeling technique, but they suffer from high-variance.<br>
This means that trees can get very different results given different training data.<br>
A technique to make decision trees more robust and to achieve better performance is called bootstrap aggregation or bagging for short.<p>
